This it Tiza's first home on the web. Here, I will share my experiences through coding various aspects related to what I broadly call "Africa's place in the World".

African landscapes
======
Broadly, I investigate African landscapes as sites where multiple spatiotemporal interests manifest. African landscapes as results of negotiating, remixing, hybridizing, ignoring and resisting multiple interests. Bearing in mind the multifunctionality of African landscapes, my interests in these landscapes are around biodiversity conservation, food envrionments, and energy transitions.

I use a social and environmental justice lens in multifunctional African landscapes. The general question I ask is "what does this mean for African (non)human communities in this landscape?"

Biodiversity conservation
------
Most biodiversity conservation interventions target the 'Global South' including Africa. Who loses and who gains? What are the trade-offs?

Food environment & food systems
------
Globally there still is a push for increased food production, with African landscapes being portayed as 'underutilized'. Moreover, dependencies and focus on market-oriented agriculture can be problematic in an increasingly globalizing world during crises such as COVID-19, the Ukraine invasion, and climate variability. What role do and can African landscapes play to continue to provide food for Africans and the world? How?

Energy transitions
------
The 27th Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (COP27) that took place in Sharm el-Sheikh, Egypt, was a landmark meeting. The losses and damages deal in which vulnerable countries experiencing the harsh impacts of climate change will be compensated by countries responsible for high CO2 emissions was historic. Amidst pressure to decarbonize their energy sectors, some African countries will continue to develop their fossil fuels in the next few years so as to grow economically and eventually transition to renewable energies. What does this look like in African landscapes?
